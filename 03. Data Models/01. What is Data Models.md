### **Data Models in RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**

In RDBMS, **data models** are frameworks or structures that define how data is organized, stored, and managed. They establish rules and constraints for the data and its relationships, making it easier to represent real-world entities in a database.

Here are the main **data models** used in RDBMS:

---

### **1. Hierarchical Data Model**
- **Description**: Organizes data in a tree-like structure, where records (nodes) have parent-child relationships. Each child node has only one parent.
- **Example**: An organization’s structure with a single manager (parent) and multiple employees (children).
- **Limitation**: Not flexible for complex relationships as it supports only a one-to-many relationship.

---

### **2. Network Data Model**
- **Description**: Represents data as a graph structure with nodes and edges, allowing many-to-many relationships between records.
- **Example**: A database for suppliers and parts, where multiple suppliers provide multiple parts.
- **Limitation**: Complex design and navigation.

---

### **3. Relational Data Model (RDM)** 
- **Description**: Represents data in **tabular form**, with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are defined through **keys** (primary and foreign keys).
- **Example**: A `Student` table with attributes like `Student_ID`, `Name`, and `Course`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple structure.
  - Flexibility with joins to form relationships.
  - Most commonly used in modern RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

---

### **4. Entity-Relationship Model (ER Model)**
- **Description**: A conceptual framework that visually represents data as **entities** (objects) and **relationships** between them. It’s often used during database design.
- **Example**: A university database with entities like `Student`, `Course`, and `Professor`, and relationships like "enrolls" and "teaches."
- **Advantage**: Clear representation for database design before implementation.

---

### **5. Object-Oriented Data Model**
- **Description**: Combines object-oriented programming concepts with databases. Data is represented as objects that encapsulate both attributes and methods.
- **Example**: A multimedia database storing videos and audio files as objects with methods to play or edit them.

### **Summary**
- **Relational Data Model** is the most widely used in RDBMS due to its simplicity and flexibility.
- Data models help in structuring and organizing data effectively, ensuring consistency and ease of management in a relational database.
