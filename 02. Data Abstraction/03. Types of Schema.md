# Types of Schemas -

In an RDBMS, schemas are used to define the **structure, constraints, and relationships** of the data. There are different types of schemas based on their role in database design and management. Here's an in-depth explanation of the **types of schemas** in RDBMS, with examples:

---

### **1. Physical Schema**
- **Definition**:  
  The physical schema describes the **physical storage of data** in the database, such as how the data is stored on disk, indexing methods, file organization, and access paths.
  
- **Characteristics**:
  - It defines the **hardware-level implementation**.
  - Specifies **storage formats, block sizes, compression techniques**, and **data partitioning**.
  - Not visible to end users but critical for database administrators.

- **Example**:  
  Imagine a database table `Employee`:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employee (
      EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT,
      Department VARCHAR(30)
  );
  ```
  - The **physical schema** could specify:
    - The table `Employee` is stored on Disk 1.
    - Indexing is done on the `EmpID` column.
    - Rows are stored in **B+ Tree format** for efficient searching.

### **2. Logical Schema**
- **Definition**:  
  The logical schema represents the **logical structure** of the database, describing tables, views, indexes, and relationships without focusing on how they are physically implemented.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Concerned with **what data is stored** and the relationships between entities.
  - Includes **constraints** (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
  - Used by database designers and developers.

- **Example**:  
  A **logical schema** for a `School` database:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Students (
      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT,
      Class VARCHAR(20)
  );

  CREATE TABLE Teachers (
      TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Subject VARCHAR(30)
  );

  CREATE TABLE Classes (
      ClassID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      ClassName VARCHAR(30),
      TeacherID INT,
      FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Teachers(TeacherID)
  );
  ```
  - This schema defines the logical structure of the database:
    - `Students`, `Teachers`, and `Classes` tables.
    - Relationships: Each class is assigned a teacher (`TeacherID` as a foreign key).

---

### **3. View Schema**
- **Definition**:  
  The view schema defines the **views** created from database tables. A view is a **virtual table** that displays data derived from one or more tables without storing it physically.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Simplifies complex queries for end users.
  - Provides a **layer of abstraction** by hiding certain details of the database.
  - Often used for **security purposes** to restrict access to specific columns or rows.

- **Example**:  
  Suppose you have a database with `Employees` and `Salaries` tables:
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW EmployeeSummary AS
  SELECT EmpID, Name, Department, Salary
  FROM Employees
  JOIN Salaries ON Employees.EmpID = Salaries.EmpID
  WHERE Salary > 50000;
  ```
  - The **view schema** defines the virtual table `EmployeeSummary`:
    - It combines data from `Employees` and `Salaries`.
    - Only employees with salaries > 50,000 are visible.

---

### **4. External Schema (or Subschema)**
- **Definition**:  
  The external schema defines how **end users interact** with the database. It provides a customized view of the data for different users or groups, hiding irrelevant details.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Also called a **user view**.
  - Ensures **data security and simplicity** by showing only what users need to see.
  - Different external schemas can exist for different user roles (e.g., admins, managers).

- **Example**:  
  In a hospital database:
  - **Doctors’ View**: Doctors see patient names, medical history, and prescriptions:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW DoctorView AS
    SELECT PatientID, Name, MedicalHistory, Prescription
    FROM Patients;
    ```
  - **Receptionists’ View**: Receptionists only see patient names and contact details:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW ReceptionistView AS
    SELECT PatientID, Name, ContactDetails
    FROM Patients;
    ```

  The **external schema** customizes data access for different roles.

### **Hierarchy of Schemas**
In RDBMS, the **schema levels** can be visualized as a **three-tier architecture**:

1. **Physical Level (Physical Schema)**:  
   - How data is stored and accessed.
   - Deals with blocks, files, and indexes.
   
2. **Logical Level (Logical Schema)**:  
   - The overall database structure.
   - Defines tables, columns, constraints, and relationships.

3. **View Level (View/External Schema)**:  
   - How users interact with data.
   - Provides customized views for different roles.

### **Comparison of Schema Types**
| **Type**            | **Purpose**                                             | **Users**                          | **Example**                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Physical Schema**  | Defines how data is stored and retrieved physically.    | DBAs                               | File storage, indexing.      |
| **Logical Schema**   | Defines tables, relationships, and constraints.         | Developers, designers              | ER models, table structure.  |
| **View Schema**      | Represents virtual tables created from base tables.     | End users                          | `EmployeeSummary` view.      |
| **External Schema**  | Customizes data views for different user groups.        | End users, admins, roles           | Doctors’ view vs. receptionists’ view. |
